The overarching goal of  this project is to develop a coherent set  of econometric methods to
deal with  unobserved heterogeneity in  the analysis  of social interactions  between agents.
Such heterogeneity  is well  recognized to  be important. It  is often  of great  interest to
document the  degree of  heterogeneity, evaluate  its impact, and  uncover the  existence and
form of  any complementarities that may  exist between agents. With  the growing availability
of network  data, questions of this  kind are increasingly  being asked in applied  work. The
development of appropriate econometric tools to  answer them has, however, not followed suit.
If anything,  recent theoretical  work has  pointed at substantial  difficulties with  the so
called fixed-effect approach currently serving as the workhorse tool.

<br><br>

This project  recognizes the  potential of  taking a random-effect  view. For  settings where
agents  interact in  pairs,  such a  view  has  received some  attention  in the  literature.
However, to  date, it struggles with  issues of identification, estimation,  and computation.
We will develop a new nonparametric approach that  provides a solution to each of these three
issues. We  will next venture  forward and extend this  framework to situations  where agents
interact  in  larger  groups.  Both  collaborative and  non-collaborative  settings  will  be
considered,  thereby  covering  team  production,  competition,  and  peer  effects.  Special
attention  will  be  given  to  recovering  treatment  effects  in  the  presence  of  social
interactions,  where interference  on unobservable  confounders is  an issue.  For situations
where data limitations prevent a  fully nonparametric approach, instrumental-variable methods
that  build on  flexible  functional form  restrictions will  be  developed. </p>
