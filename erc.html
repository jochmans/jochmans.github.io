<b> Inference in Microeconometric Models (MiMo) </b>
<br>
ERC Starting Grant 715787 (2017--2022)

<br><br>

<p align="justify", style="text-left:40px"> Unobserved differences between economic agents
are an important driver behind the differences in their economic outcomes such as schooling
decisions, wages, and employment durations. Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in
economic modelling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but
presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the
data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. <br><br> The aim of this
project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by
exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three
Work Packages (WP). Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel
data. <br><br> The first WP deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the
performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point
estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data
and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second WP makes progress on the
estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is
well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data
can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third WP uses panel data to
identify and nonparametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type
heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic
discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization.
<br><br> The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and
they will be applied to various empirical problems.</p>
